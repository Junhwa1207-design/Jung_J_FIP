# Jung_J_FIP


This is a Junhwa Jung's portfolio website that contains design works as a designer, illustrator and developer.
Even though there is no UI work, my goal is UI designer and, I will add more UI works additionally.
To catch the eyes of the users, this website tries to implement dynamic effects by using various CSS animations and Javascript functions.

In terms of design, I used
1. flex-box.
2. CSS animation for using gradient colors and changing shape of boxs, and dynamic buttons etc.


In terms of develop, I used
1. css modules with SASS.
2. Data and AJAX. 
3. Javascript functions for pop-up window, scroll down etc.
